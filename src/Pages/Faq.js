          <b>How Much is a Safety Inspection for my vehicle?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Safety Standards Inspection is $150 and it covers the Provincially
          Mandated Motor Vehicle Inspection procedure as prescribed by the
          Ontario Ministry of Transportation. This cost includes the price of
          inspection and Certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Why is the Pre-Purchase Inspection more costly than the Safety
            Inspection?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pre-Purchase inspection is a far more comprehensive Inspection
          process which covers 300 vehicle reference points. While the Safety
          Standard inspection covers the safe operation of a motor vehicle, the
          pre-purchase inspection covers points which fall outside the purview
          of basic safety standards. For example, torn arm rest, worn spark
          plugs, fluid health or malfunctioning Entertainment system might be
          important when deciding whether to purchase a vehicle, yet they are
          not considered Provincially mandated safety standards. This added
          scrutiny contributes to a greater use of the Motor Vehicle Inspection
          Stations time and effort which translates to a higher service cost.

          <b>How do I arrange Drop off and Pick up of my vehicle?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you choose a time and date that best fits your schedule, you can
          either choose to drop off and pick up your vehicle at the designated
          Motor Vehicle Inspection Centre or choose to take advantage our full
          service concierge service for an additional cost of $59.95+HST.
        </p>

          <b>How long does it take to have my vehicle inspected?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspections can be a tedious process and deserve devoted time and
          attention. Considering the sensitive nature of a vehicle inspection,
          we ask that you prepare to have your vehicle dedicated to the Motor
          Vehicle Inspection for the entire day of your scheduled inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Why can’t the inspection be done remotely?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Although, a pre-purchase inspection can technically be done remotely,
          the Provincially mandated Motor Vehicle Safety Inspection requires a
          vehicle to be inspected within a designated Motor Vehicle Inspection
          Station in order to qualify for a Safety Standards Certificate.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How do I receive my Safety Report?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your Safety or Pre-Purchase Inspection have been completed, you
          will receive a full comprehensive Inspect This Car vehicle inspection
          report delivered to the email address provided at the time of
          scheduling. You will also receive a Service Estimate for any repairs
          required in order to satisfy Minsitry Safety and Non Safety standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>How do I get my Safety Certificate?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Safety Standards Certificate will be provided to you upon the
          completion and satisfaction of all safety related repairs or
          requirements. This certificate is provided by the affiliated Motor
          Vehicle Inspection Station upon completion of required service at the
          time of vehicle pick up.
        </p>

          <b>
            Do I have to agree to the estimate provided to secure Provincial
            Safety Standards?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          No, you have full authority to refuse the recommended service upon
          receipt of your estimate. If any service/repairs are required, they
          must be completed within 30 days of report to maintain certificate
          eligibility, as per Provincial requirements.

            How does liability work if I choose the concierge pick up service?
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The transported vehicles are insured by the affiliated MVIS Service
          Station Policy. Upon pickup, a “Yellow Plate” will be secured to the
          vehicle for transport and subsequently be covered by the Affiliates
          commercial policy.
